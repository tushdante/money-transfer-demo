# Money Transfer 
Demonstrates a simple Money Transfer in Temporal implemented in different languages. 

The workflow is designed so that the "Happy Path" is one workflow and all other scenarios are implemented using a Dyanmic Workflow.

Scenarios currently implemented include
* Happy Path                - everything works as intended
* Advanced Visibility       - updates a Search Attribute (Step) as it progesses through the workflow
* Require Human in the Loop - Shows how to use a signal with timeouts if not approved in time
* API Downtime              - Demonstrates an unreliable API (recovers after the 5th attempt)
* Bug in Workflow           - Purposefully throws/raises an error (fix and redeploy the worker)
* Invalid Account           - How to exit a workflow for business purposes (fail the workflow)

## Running the Demo locally
Start Temporal Locally

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

Create a Search Attribute 
```bash
temporal operator search-attribute create --name Step --type Keyword
```

### Start the UX 
Next, start the UX which is written using the Java SDK

```bash
cd ui
./startlocalwebui.sh
```

Navigate to http://localhost:7000 in a web browser to interact with the UX

### Start a worker

Now start a worker. You can choose to use the Java, Go or .NET Worker below

#### Java Worker
In a new terminal, start the Java Worker 
```bash
cd java
./startlocalworker.sh
```

#### Golang Worker
In a new terminal, start the Golang Worker

```bash
cd go
./startlocalworker.sh
```

#### .NET Worker
In a new terminal, start the .NET Worker

```bash
cd dotnet
./startlocalworker.sh
```

## Running the Demo on Temporal Cloud
Set up a search attribute in your namespace using the following command

```bash
tcld login
tcld namespace search-attributes add --namespace <namespace>.<accountId> --search-attribute "Step=Keyword"
```

Copy the setcloundenv.example to setcloudenv.sh 
```bash
cp setcloudenv.example setcloudenv.sh
```

Edit setcloudenv.sh to match your Temporal Cloud account:
```bash
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=<namespace>.<accountID>.tmprl.cloud:7233
export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=<namespace>.<accountID>
export TEMPORAL_CERT_PATH="/path/to/cert.pem"
export TEMPORAL_KEY_PATH="/path/to/key.key"
```
